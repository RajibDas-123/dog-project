## Overview 

This is an image classification project that uses Convolutional Nural Network(CNN) to detect and classify a dog breed in a photo.

## Project Motivation

CNNs in deep learning scenarios has been to address many of the limitations that traditional neural networks faced when applied to those problems. When used in areas like image classification, traditional fully-connected neural networks simply donâ€™t scale well due to their disproportionally large number of connections. CNNs bring a few new ideas that contribute to improve the efficiency of deep neural networks.
Transfer learning is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the project  
The other files are prepared by Udacity and was there in the workspace
